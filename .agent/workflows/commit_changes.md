description: Safely commit all changes to the repository with a standardized process
---
1. Check the current status to verify changes
   git status

2. Add all changes (including new and deleted files) to the staging area. Using -A is safer than . for deleted files.
   // turbo
   git add -A

3. Commit the changes. The user should provide the commit message.
   IMPORTANT: The commit message MUST be written in KOREAN.
   git commit -m "${commit_message}"
